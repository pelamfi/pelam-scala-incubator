# Project Pelam Scala Incubator

Pelam's open source utility code collection.

The idea is that I will collect all kinds of useful bits of code here without worrying
about things like dependencies.

Just let me know and I will break out any smaller piece of this project and publish 
it separately!

If something in here turns out to be generally useful for somebody else, 
it is only right and just to be able to use it witout cruft and additional useless dependencies.

## Current Dependencies

  * Akka -- Concurrency framework used among other things to provide UI reponsiveness
  * JavaFX -- UI framework

## History of this project

Most of this code was originally developed for a custom project called Ahma.
I broke these bits of code off from Ahma as I felt that some of them could
become generally useful open source Scala libraries. As a note about the Git history,
I just copied the bits of code over from the Ahma project. I did not bother to clean
up and bring over the Git history from Ahma.
